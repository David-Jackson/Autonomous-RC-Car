This test was meant to evaluate the possibility of using one LIDAR sensor rotating on a servo mount to sense objects in the RC Car's proximity. It was determined that the LIDAR sensor on a servo motor was not accurate enough for the purposes of this project. The sensor had too much noise and was not accurate within 5 inches.
